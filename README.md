DCAC
====

DCAC is a practical OS-level access control system that supports
application-defined principals. It allows normal users to perform
administrative operations within their privilege, enabling isolation and
privilege separation for applications. It does not require centralized
policy specification or management, giving applications freedom to
manage their principals while the policies are still enforced by the
OS. DCAC uses hierarchically-named attributes as a generic framework
for user-defined policies such as groups defined by normal users.

DCAC also supports NFSv3.
